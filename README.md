# Pokedex-Lite
A Lite Pok√©dex application that uses the pokeapi api (https://pokeapi.co/)

## Current functionality:
The app currently provides very limited functionality. We list the first 100 pokemon from the API in a locally searchable list.
You can also view limited details for each pokemon

## Technical notes:
- The application has been split into multiple modules using Swift Packages. 
- All logic within the app has been unit tested
- MVVM
- Attempts were made to use the latest iOS technology where possible (SwiftUI, Async/Await, etc)
